      "description": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga. In Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines...."

In Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines...."

In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

In Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines...."

      "description": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga. In Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins.

      "description": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga. In Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

      "description": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga. In Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

As he unravels        the astonishing truth, Bond must fight deadly assassins, sexy femme's        fatales and even a poisonous tarantula. With the help of crack CIA        agents Felix Lieter (Jack Lord) and the beautiful Honey Ryder (Ursula        Andress), he searches for the headquarters of Dr. No, who is        implementing an evil plan of world domination.Only Bond, with his combination of wit, charm and skill, can confront        the madman and save the human race from a horrible fate. With        breathtaking chases, amazing stunts and a bold, nerve-shattering climax,        this outrageously entertaining adventure pushes the envelope for        non-stop thrills and magnificently sets the standard for the most        popular movie series in film history.For        Your Eyes Only (1981): When        a British ship sinks in foreign waters, the world's superpowers begin a        feverish race to find its cargo: a nuclear submarine control system. And        007 (Roger Moore) is thrust into one of his most riveting adventures as        he rushes to join the search...and prevent global devastation!        From        Russia With Love (1963): The        evil organization SPECTRE has hatched a plan to steal a decoder that        will access Russian state secrets and irrevocably unbalance the world        order. It is up to James Bond to seize the device first, but he must        confront enemies that include Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb, a        former KGB agent with poison-tipped shoes.Even as Bond romances a stunning Soviet defector, he realizes he is        being lured into a deadly trap, and he will need all of his courage,        abilities and cutting-edge technology to triumph over the forces that        seek to destroy him.        Die        Another Day (2002): James        Bond's mission begins with a spectacular high-speed hovercraft chase        through a minefield in the demilitarized zone separating North and South        Korea - and the action doesn't let up until the credits roll. From Hong        Kong to Cuba to London, Bond circles the world in his quest to unmask a        traitor and prevent a war of catastrophic proportions. On his way he        crosses paths with Jinx (Oscar ®-winner Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost        (Rosamund Pike), who will play vital roles in his latest adventure. Hot        on the trail of deadly megalomaniac Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) and        his ruthless right-hand man Zao (Rick Yune), Bond travels to Iceland        into the villain's lair: a palace built entirely of ice. There he        experiences firsthand the power of a new hi-tech weapon. Ultimately it        all leads to an explosive confrontation - and an unforgettable        conclusion - back in Korea where it all started.        Live        And Let Die (1973): In        Roger Moore's first outing as 007, he investigates the murders of three        fellow agents, he soon finds himself a target, evading vicious assassins        as he closes in on the powerful Kananga (Yaphet Kotto).Known on the streets as \"Mr Big\", Kananga is co-ordinating a globally        threatening scheme using tons of self-produced heroin. As Bond tries to        unravel the mastermind's plan, he meets Solitaire (Jane Seymour), the        beautiful Tarot card reader whose magical gifts are crucial to the crime        lord. Bond, of course, works his own magic on her, and the stage is set        for a series of pulse-pounding action sequences involving voodoo, hungry        crocodiles and turbo-charged speedboats.        Thunderball        (1965): The        thrills never stop as Agent 007 (Sean Connery) goes above the call of        duty - and to the bottom of the ocean - to track down a villainous        criminal who's holding millions hostage and threatening to plunge the        world into a nuclear holocaust!",

With        breathtaking chases, amazing stunts and a bold, nerve-shattering climax,        this outrageously entertaining adventure pushes the envelope for        non-stop thrills and magnificently sets the standard for the most        popular movie series in film history.For        Your Eyes Only (1981): When        a British ship sinks in foreign waters, the world's superpowers begin a        feverish race to find its cargo: a nuclear submarine control system. And        007 (Roger Moore) is thrust into one of his most riveting adventures as        he rushes to join the search...and prevent global devastation!        From        Russia With Love (1963): The        evil organization SPECTRE has hatched a plan to steal a decoder that        will access Russian state secrets and irrevocably unbalance the world        order. It is up to James Bond to seize the device first, but he must        confront enemies that include Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb, a        former KGB agent with poison-tipped shoes.Even as Bond romances a stunning Soviet defector, he realizes he is        being lured into a deadly trap, and he will need all of his courage,        abilities and cutting-edge technology to triumph over the forces that        seek to destroy him.        Die        Another Day (2002): James        Bond's mission begins with a spectacular high-speed hovercraft chase        through a minefield in the demilitarized zone separating North and South        Korea - and the action doesn't let up until the credits roll. From Hong        Kong to Cuba to London, Bond circles the world in his quest to unmask a        traitor and prevent a war of catastrophic proportions. On his way he        crosses paths with Jinx (Oscar ®-winner Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost        (Rosamund Pike), who will play vital roles in his latest adventure. Hot        on the trail of deadly megalomaniac Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) and        his ruthless right-hand man Zao (Rick Yune), Bond travels to Iceland        into the villain's lair: a palace built entirely of ice. There he        experiences firsthand the power of a new hi-tech weapon. Ultimately it        all leads to an explosive confrontation - and an unforgettable        conclusion - back in Korea where it all started.        Live        And Let Die (1973): In        Roger Moore's first outing as 007, he investigates the murders of three        fellow agents, he soon finds himself a target, evading vicious assassins        as he closes in on the powerful Kananga (Yaphet Kotto).Known on the streets as \"Mr Big\", Kananga is co-ordinating a globally        threatening scheme using tons of self-produced heroin. As Bond tries to        unravel the mastermind's plan, he meets Solitaire (Jane Seymour), the        beautiful Tarot card reader whose magical gifts are crucial to the crime        lord. Bond, of course, works his own magic on her, and the stage is set        for a series of pulse-pounding action sequences involving voodoo, hungry        crocodiles and turbo-charged speedboats.        Thunderball        (1965): The        thrills never stop as Agent 007 (Sean Connery) goes above the call of        duty - and to the bottom of the ocean - to track down a villainous        criminal who's holding millions hostage and threatening to plunge the        world into a nuclear holocaust!..."

In 'Prometheus' (2012), after finding fragments of Alien DNA, a team of scientists known as The Company travels into space aboard the state-of-the-art Prometheus spacecraft to investigate the origins of human life on Earth. Their journey takes them into the darkest corners of the universe - but, to their horror, their very inquisitiveness ends up posing a threat to the future existence of humankind. The scientists now find themselves tested to their mental and physical limits as they fight a desperate battle to preserve the future of the human race. In 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

      "description": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga, plus the prequel 'Prometheus'. In 'Prometheus' (2012), after finding fragments of Alien DNA, a team of scientists known as The Company travels into space aboard the state-of-the-art Prometheus spacecraft to investigate the origins of human life on Earth. Their journey takes them into the darkest corners of the universe - but, to their horror, their very inquisitiveness ends up posing a threat to the future existence of humankind. The scientists now find themselves tested to their mental and physical limits as they fight a desperate battle to preserve the future of the human race. In 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

      "description": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga, plus the prequel 'Prometheus'. In 'Prometheus' (2012), after finding fragments of Alien DNA, a team of scientists known as The Company travels into space aboard the state-of-the-art Prometheus spacecraft to investigate the origins of human life on Earth. Their journey takes them into the darkest corners of the universe - but, to their horror, their very inquisitiveness ends up posing a threat to the future existence of humankind. The scientists now find themselves tested to their mental and physical limits as they fight a desperate battle to preserve the future of the human race. In 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

As he unravels        the astonishing truth, Bond must fight deadly assassins, sexy femme's        fatales and even a poisonous tarantula. With the help of crack CIA        agents Felix Lieter (Jack Lord) and the beautiful Honey Ryder (Ursula        Andress), he searches for the headquarters of Dr. No, who is        implementing an evil plan of world domination.Only Bond, with his combination of wit, charm and skill, can confront        the madman and save the human race from a horrible fate. With        breathtaking chases, amazing stunts and a bold, nerve-shattering climax,        this outrageously entertaining adventure pushes the envelope for        non-stop thrills and magnificently sets the standard for the most        popular movie series in film history.For        Your Eyes Only (1981): When        a British ship sinks in foreign waters, the world's superpowers begin a        feverish race to find its cargo: a nuclear submarine control system. And        007 (Roger Moore) is thrust into one of his most riveting adventures as        he rushes to join the search...and prevent global devastation!        From        Russia With Love (1963): The        evil organization SPECTRE has hatched a plan to steal a decoder that        will access Russian state secrets and irrevocably unbalance the world        order. It is up to James Bond to seize the device first, but he must        confront enemies that include Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb, a        former KGB agent with poison-tipped shoes.Even as Bond romances a stunning Soviet defector, he realizes he is        being lured into a deadly trap, and he will need all of his courage,        abilities and cutting-edge technology to triumph over the forces that        seek to destroy him.        Die        Another Day (2002): James        Bond's mission begins with a spectacular high-speed hovercraft chase        through a minefield in the demilitarized zone separating North and South        Korea - and the action doesn't let up until the credits roll. From Hong        Kong to Cuba to London, Bond circles the world in his quest to unmask a        traitor and prevent a war of catastrophic proportions. On his way he        crosses paths with Jinx (Oscar ®-winner Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost        (Rosamund Pike), who will play vital roles in his latest adventure. Hot        on the trail of deadly megalomaniac Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) and        his ruthless right-hand man Zao (Rick Yune), Bond travels to Iceland        into the villain's lair: a palace built entirely of ice. There he        experiences firsthand the power of a new hi-tech weapon. Ultimately it        all leads to an explosive confrontation - and an unforgettable        conclusion - back in Korea where it all started.        Live        And Let Die (1973): In        Roger Moore's first outing as 007, he investigates the murders of three        fellow agents, he soon finds himself a target, evading vicious assassins        as he closes in on the powerful Kananga (Yaphet Kotto).Known on the streets as \"Mr Big\", Kananga is co-ordinating a globally        threatening scheme using tons of self-produced heroin. As Bond tries to        unravel the mastermind's plan, he meets Solitaire (Jane Seymour), the        beautiful Tarot card reader whose magical gifts are crucial to the crime        lord. Bond, of course, works his own magic on her, and the stage is set        for a series of pulse-pounding action sequences involving voodoo, hungry        crocodiles and turbo-charged speedboats.        Thunderball        (1965): The        thrills never stop as Agent 007 (Sean Connery) goes above the call of        duty - and to the bottom of the ocean - to track down a villainous        criminal who's holding millions hostage and threatening to plunge the        world into a nuclear holocaust!",

      "description": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga, plus the prequel 'Prometheus'. In 'Prometheus' (2012), after finding fragments of Alien DNA, a team of scientists known as The Company travels into space aboard the state-of-the-art Prometheus spacecraft to investigate the origins of human life on Earth. Their journey takes them into the darkest corners of the universe - but, to their horror, their very inquisitiveness ends up posing a threat to the future existence of humankind. The scientists now find themselves tested to their mental and physical limits as they fight a desperate battle to preserve the future of the human race. In 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

In 'Prometheus' (2012), after finding fragments of Alien DNA, a team of scientists known as The Company travels into space aboard the state-of-the-art Prometheus spacecraft to investigate the origins of human life on Earth. Their journey takes them into the darkest corners of the universe - but, to their horror, their very inquisitiveness ends up posing a threat to the future existence of humankind. The scientists now find themselves tested to their mental and physical limits as they fight a desperate battle to preserve the future of the human race. In 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines.",

      "description_extract": "All four films in the 'Alien' saga, plus the prequel 'Prometheus'. In 'Prometheus' (2012), after finding fragments of Alien DNA, a team of scientists known as The Company travels into space aboard the state-of-the-art Prometheus spacecraft to investigate the origins of human life on Earth. Their journey takes them into the darkest corners of the universe - but, to their horror, their very inquisitiveness ends up posing a threat to the future existence of humankind. The scientists now find themselves tested to their mental and physical limits as they fight a desperate battle to preserve the future of the human race. In 'Alien' (1979) the crew of a deep-space mining vessel come across something decidedly unpleasant on a mysterious planet. After leaving the desolate planet, they realise that something has survived and is on their ship. In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins. In David Fincher's dark and brooding 'Alien 3' (1992) Ripley crash lands on an old prison planet for convicted murderers - but something has hitched a ride with her. Finally, in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 'Alien Resurrection' (1997), two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died bearing the Alien Queen, a group of scientists successfully produce clones of both her and the alien. The new Ripley is different to the original in several respects, but some things never change. It is not long before Ripley is forced to team up with a gang of smugglers to repel the acid-blooded killing machines...."

In James Cameron's sequel, 'Aliens' (1986), sole survivor Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a team of Space Marines return to the alien's home planet to investigate some mysterious happenings, but soon a new deadly game of cat-and-mouse begins.
